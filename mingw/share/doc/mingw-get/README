Description
-----------

mingw-get  is a tool to assist users in the management of MinGW and MSYS
software installations.  Configured via an online XML database, which is
managed  by the project maintainers, it offers a choice of graphical and
command line driven user interfaces facilitating selective download  and
installation of packages provided by the project.

The   XML  database  provides  maintainers  with  a  mechanism  for  the
specification of inter-package dependencies; this permits  configuration
of  any  package,  such that the end user may elect to install just that
specific package, leaving mingw-get to ensure that all dependencies will
be automatically satisfied at installation time.
